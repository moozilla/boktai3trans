 Progress/Todo
===================

Near Todo:
 - Tiny on map name graphics
 - Shop menu titles

Progress:

(6/11/07)
 - Hacked all world map names
 - Found town name data, hacked all town names
 - Map names in patch (map_names.ips)
 
(6/10/07)
 - Started hacking in map names
 - May need to find how to change which sprites are loaded for each name
   - "CEMETERY" uses 4, only needs 2, "DARK CASTLE" needs 3, only has 2
   - Found it, see notes below

(6/08/07)
 - Replayed through game, not as far but to map
 - Found map sprite data! C819D1 is data for 2nd YA in YADOYA
   - First byte is canned size/shape

(6/07/07)
 - Played through game a bit (not saved thanks to crash >_<)
 - Was working on finding map sprite data, but no$gba crashed
 - [30047F8]! to find routine where it ors OAM data together
 - Breakpoint on x-pos/y-pos place, found where it's made, on to something?

(6/01/07)
 - Finished hacking menu titles, (IPS: menu-titles)
 - Started hacking warning screen
   - Graphics at 68CED4
   - Tilemap at 68E954 (compressed)

(5/31/07)
- Continued Menu Title Hacking
 - Found where data 80204000 is calculated, 80004000 is stored at 3004D74
 - 3004D74 loaded when game is loaded
 - 8217144 routine that stores data
 - turns out this is just a sequential thing, probably for sizes or something
 - need to find what makes it load this particular one
 - FOUND OUT HOW THEY'RE STORED!

(5/30/07)
- Continued
 - DMA loads data from 3004410 (- 80) to OAM
 - Set [3004410]! breakpoint to find code that loads sprites
 - Couldn't find where in ROM loaded from to set up for above code

(5/15/07)
- Continued trying to figure out how menu names are stored
 - Uses DMA to load tile data from ROM to tile data area
 - [20390e4] is how much tile data is incremented?
 - Break on sprite creation, trace there, find how sprites are stored

(4/13/07)
- Looked into changing menu names (item, status, etc.)
 - Graphics stored around C15880
 - Pieces of each are reused (ex. in aitemu, and sute-tasu, the same te)
 - Will need to change where sprites are loaded from, so need to debug routine

(4/11/07)
- Debugging to find how tilemaps are stored

(4/09/07)
- Started translating menus

(3/26/07)
- Finally found a translator! TripleL contacted me on RHDN.

(3/19/07)
- Made dumper dump entire strings but it froze
- Dumped script with WindHex
- Inserted a small bit from translation FAQ for testing

(3/17/07)
- Figured out how pointers work and how strings are loaded
- Started script dumper
  - Dumps strings based on string number (gets pointer from table)
- SJS turned unicode chars into Japanese so removed them (probably not used)

(3/15/07)
- Redid table and did a small test dump added two control codes

(3/11/07)
 - Got missing Kanji identified

(3/10/07)
 - Inserted all identified Kanji into table
 - Dumped English font and inserted all English in table

(3/1/07)
 - Dumped font for Kanji identification
 - Made basic table with kana and some ASCII (still need punctuation)

(2/28/07)
 - Intial investigation, found most if not all graphics
 - Found some text stuff
 - Played game a bit

Long Run Todo:
 - Fix and complete table (remove blanks, fix duplicates)
 - Find code to control sun meter!
 - Find out how pointers work exactly
 - Make dumper/inserter
 - Dump script
 - Translate script
 - Insert script
 - Translate graphics
 - Playtest

Notes:
 - Remember screen(s) that appear when no button on main menu after several seconds
 - Localize timezones
 - Find a way to remove boxes of dialog

Everything that needs to be translated:
 - Intro screens
 - Title screen
 - Setup and start menus
 - Name and password entry
 - In game menus
 - Dark loans
 - Forging (?)
 - Dialog
 - Maps
 - Probably more

 Text Notes
===================

General Notes:
- Control codes are very interesting! ASCII tags like <LABEL=SABATA>, etc.
- English text seems is ASCII, Japanese is 2 bytes
- 4 byte relative pointers
- Each string ends with [end] (00)
- Dialogs end with <PROC=0>[line]<END>
- Number of strings: 26F8
- Length of dump in bytes: 61DB9 (to DD6B95)

Locations of Interest:
 D6B1F8 - Pointer table
 D74DDC - Start of text
 DCBDAA - test string 21e5

 Assembly Notes
===================

821ADD4 - routine that loads pointer from string number (test string: 21e5)
821ADF6 - adds to r0, r2 is pointer offset, r0=8D74DDC

How pointers work:

Loads pointer from pointer table, bitmasks 0x7FFFFFFF and adds to 8D74DDC
Start of pointer table: 8D6B1F8

 Menu Translation
===================

Notes:
- Graphics located at 70A230
- Tilemap is loaded from 70C238 at 8216716
  - Looks like it's compressed somehow (I think it's custom)

Titles:

aitemu		- ITEMS
???		- VALUABLES
???		- SOLAR GUN
suteetasu	- STATUS
konfigu		- CONFIG
suriipu		- SLEEP
seebu		- SAVE
mappu		- MAP

Status screen:

jikan   - TIME
sutando - ? (STAND?)
keiken  - EXP
tsugi   - NEXT
banku   - BANK
roon    - LOAN
hinode  - SUNRISE (RISE?)
karada  - VITL
kokoro  - SPRT
chikara - STRG

====================
 Menu Title Hacking
====================

- Sprite in question: "suMS" and the status menu
- OAM data: 4000,8020,31F8
- 40 = normal, horizantal shape	00 = y-pos
- 80 = normal, size 32x16;	20 = x-pos
- 31F8 = priority, palette, tile 1F8

Need to change:
- Tiles loaded
- Positions/sizes
- Remove sprites (or just make them all small)

Todo:
- Figure out where and how it stores which tiles loaded for each menu
- Change

Notes:
- It uses "canned" sizes except for x-positions (ors that in)
- Find how it stores which canned one, which x-pos
- 02 = 16x8, 04 = 16x16, 09 = 32x16

Progress:
- Some debugging, need to find where loaded from in ROM
- 300093C ors 1F8 and 3 to make 31F8
- 3 loaded from 3007A8C, 1F8 loaded from 30042E8
- Seems like 1F8 is just part of a loop (of all sprites)
- 3007A58 stores 9, lsl 3 to get 24 which is that canned size
- 8C10F7D is 9, and 8C10F7E is 20 (x-pos)!
- 8C10F82 somehow stores where tiles are loaded from!
- All translated!

 Map Location Name Hacking

Word sprite data:

C81730 = SAN MIGUEL start
C81342 = number of cemetery sprites
C81350 = offset from 8C81548
C819D1 is data for 2nd YA in YADOYA
C81A50 graphics data 65211C small font (for reference)
[200A020]!, r4+2 = no of sprites, r4+8 = offset

Town sprite data:

[2009D0C]!
offset from 8C81548
